1) create model.py
    define user model

2)define config constants and config

  7 DEBUG=True
  8 PORT=8000
  9 HOST="0.0.0.0"
 
  
 26 if __name__ == "__name__":
 27     app.run(debug=DEBUG,host=HOST,port=PORT)



3)define before and after request behavior

         13 @app.before.request
         14 def before_request():
         15     """Connect to the database before each request"""
         16     g.db=models.DATABASE
         17     g.db.connect()
         18     
         19 @app.after.request
         20 def after_request(response):
         21     """Close the database connection after each request"""
         22     g.db.close()
         23     return response

4) setup login manager. (from flask.ext.login import LoginManager) 
    defined secret key
    
    defined login manager instance and initialized it
     login_manager=LoginManager()
     login_manager.init_App(app)
      
    defined load_user function

5)defined initialize function on models.py
    and 
        do that on app.py   

     44 if __name__ == "__name__":
     45     app.run(debug=DEBUG,host=HOST,port=PORT)
     46     models.initialize()

6) to create a super user we added
    a create_user function call under that if name==main part
    

 7) Created login view with wtforms

    to do that we created another file called forms.py     
    it is very informative with my own comments
    easy to understand

8)Now we wanna render that form, we wanna send it to a template
    create a route for register
    read commends on that part on app.py

9)Created out html form in register.html

10) created a file called macros.html
    cut the div from form tags in the register.html and
    copied in to macros.html

    and in the place of what is deleted we write
    {{ render_field(field) }}
11) its time for creating a login form

    go to forms create a neww class. LoginForm
